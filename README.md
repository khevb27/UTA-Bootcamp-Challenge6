## Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard
----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description

This application allows users to view the current weather and 5-day forecast for any city. Users are presented with a search form and a list of their previous search history as buttons. Users can either type in a city and submit their search or click on a previous search button to view that city's weather dashboard. The weather dashboard is comprised of a current weather display and a 5-day forecast display. The current weather display shows the city's name and current date, followed by the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity percentage for that city. The 5-day forecast display shows each day in its own box, displaying the date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity percentage.
